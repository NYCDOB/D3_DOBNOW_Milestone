## DOB NOW: Build Milestones

The New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) DOB NOW Build Milestones application displays basic details for selected DOB NOW Build filings on an interactive map of New York City. Each filing is represented as a dot on the map, and clicking the dot or the item on the list below brings you to a profile page that shows major milestone dates for that filing. The application is updated daily with the latest filings for Antenna, Curb Cut, Fence, Plumbing, Scaffold, Sidewalk Shed, Sign, Sprinkler, and Standpipe filings in DOB NOW.

## Data Source

Data flows from the BI tool to GitHub public hold. This is a daily automated process. It creates results in 2 formats: JSON (for search) and CSV (for map imaging).
